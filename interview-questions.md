# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. If you don't know the answer a good tip is to answer a simpler version of the question.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

INSTRUCTOR EXAMPLE: What is a conditional statement?

Your answer:

Researched answer:

1. What is git? What is the difference between git and Github?

Your answer: git is a version control as to github is the platform and hub to access, pull, push and merge data.

Researched answer: git is a version control system that tracks changes in any set of computer files. github is an internet hosting service for software development and version control.

2. Which JavaScript operators will return a Boolean value?

Your answer:  && will return a boolean value.

Researched answer: The logical AND (&&) (logical conjunction) operator for a set of boolean operands will be true if and only if all the operands are true. Otherwise it will be false.

3. What is an index? What is the difference between index and value?

Your answer: index is the positioning of the character or number in a string. value is a number and start from 0 as to string start from 1.

Researched answer: The indexOf() method returns the position of the first occurrence of a value in a string. The indexOf() method

4. Compare and contrast arrays and strings. Please include ways in which they are the same and ways in which they are different.

Your answer: a string are words and characters an array is data that can have strings in them. they are both data types.

Researched answer: Strings are similar to arrays with just a few differences. Usually, the array size is fixed, while strings can have a variable number of elements. Arrays can contain any data type (char short int even other arrays) while strings are usually ASCII characters terminated with a NULL (0) character.

5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

Your answer: there is a driver and navigator. the driver is usually the one to type and code while the navigator gives instructions and guidance to the driver while analyzing the code. pair programming is a technique used for developers.

Researched answer: Pair programming is a software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator,[1] reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently. While reviewing, the observer also considers the "strategic" direction of the work, coming up with ideas for improvements and likely future problems to address. This is intended to free the driver to focus all of their attention on the "tactical" aspects of completing the current task, using the observer as a safety net and guide.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Higher Order Functions: Higher-order functions. Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them, are called higher-order functions.

2. Jest: Jest is a JavaScript testing framework designed to ensure correctness of any JavaScript codebase. It allows you to write tests with an approachable, familiar and feature-rich API that gives you results quickly. Jest is well-documented, requires little configuration and can be extended to match your requirements.

3. Objects: JavaScript objects are containers for named values called properties. Object Methods. Objects can also have methods

4. Method: JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a function definition.


5. Classes: Classes are a template for creating objects. They encapsulate data with code to work on that data
